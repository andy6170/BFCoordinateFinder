You can start a new project by using one of the maps we provide or by importing your own image.

Once you have your project opened you can click anywhere on it to store a new coordinate. 
Coordinates X, Y, Z are seporated by spaces.
You can choose the type of coordinate to easily identify what it's for. 
- Spawn(Red)
- MCOM (Yellow)
- Other (Blue)

Optionally you can also add a description to add more information such as if it's inside a building or on a rooftop.

The IMPORT feature allows you to import the coordinates from a save to your project without overriding your current coordinates.

Once you are finished you can save your project locally to your computer.
